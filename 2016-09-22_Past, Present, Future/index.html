  <p> I was born four days late on May 12, 2001 at 11:59 am in <a href="https://bonsecours.com/greenville/find-a-facility/st-francis-eastside">Greenville Woman's Hospital.</a>
    My mom's name is Courtney and my dad's name is Julius and they named me Dashiona J. J. Todd.
    I grew up in a nice home and a 2 years later my mom had one of my little brothers named Da'shaun with my dad.
  After he was born, my mom and dad split up and my mom kept us. Later she had my last little brother named Tarrence.
  We haved moved houses a few times, but we have always lived in Greenville, South Carolina.</p>

  <h2>Present</h2>
  <img class="right" src="IMG_1267.JPG" alt="Me">
  <p> Currently, I am 15 years old and I go to <a href="https://www.greenville.k12.sc.us/jlmann/">J.L Mann High School.</a> I am in the 10th grade.
  I have a job at Publix that I got in the summer time.
  Life right now is very good like always and im not in trouble at the moment.
  I was going to run track again this year, but the new coast is very unorganized, so my mom said it would be better for me to find another sport to do.
  I have good grades and almost have straight A's. I really like all of my classes and teachers, but my favorite class is webpage design.
  My favorite subject is still math though.</p>

  <p>My family right now is kind of the same. My brother Da'shaun is 13 now and Tarrence is 10.
  We got a new dog named chocolate a few months ago and he loves to eat everything.
  My mom has a new boyfriend named Keis that she's been with for a long time now and he's really funny and nice and we all love him even though he can be a butthead at times.
My mom is also starting her own home health care business which is pretty cool and she wants me to make her a website for her website and im very exicted to do that becsuae it's fun, but its also kind of stressful.</p>

<h2>Future</h2>
<img class="right" src="hospital5.png" alt="Hospital">
<p>After high school  want to go to college and major in nursing and and minor in computer coding things.
The type of nursing I want to do is with babies and kids only which is pederatic nurse and I would take computer coding as minor because I could make websites and apps for businesses also.
The college I'm interested in going to is <a href="https://www.duke.edu/">Duke Univerity</a> in Durham, North Carolina.
After college I want to work in a hosptial and have a husband and a nice house.
